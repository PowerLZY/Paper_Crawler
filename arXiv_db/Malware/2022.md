> Classification of malware families is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of how they can infect devices, computers, or systems. Thus, malware identification enables security researchers and incident responders to take precautions against malware and accelerate mitigation. API call sequences made by malware are widely utilized features by machine and deep learning models for malware classification as these sequences represent the behavior of malware. However, traditional machine and deep learning models remain incapable of capturing sequence relationships between API calls. On the other hand, the transformer-based models process sequences as a whole and learn relationships between API calls due to multi-head attention mechanisms and positional embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that the transformer model with one transformer block layer surpassed the widely used base architecture, LSTM. Moreover, BERT or CANINE, pre-trained transformer models, outperformed in classifying highly imbalanced malware families according to evaluation metrics, F1-score, and AUC score. Furthermore, the proposed bagging-based random transformer forest (RTF), an ensemble of BERT or CANINE, has reached the state-of-the-art evaluation scores on three out of four datasets, particularly state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.6149 on one of the commonly used benchmark dataset.

- `2201.00900v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00900v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00900v1)

> The domain name system (DNS) that maps alphabetic names to numeric Internet Protocol (IP) addresses plays a foundational role for Internet communications. By default, DNS queries and responses are exchanged in unencrypted plaintext, and hence, can be read and/or hijacked by third parties. To protect user privacy, the networking community has proposed standard encryption technologies such as DNS over TLS (DoT), DNS over HTTPS (DoH), and DNS over QUIC (DoQ) for DNS communications, enabling clients to perform secure and private domain name lookups. We survey the DNS encryption literature published since 2016, focusing on its current landscape and how it is misused by malware, and highlighting the existing techniques developed to make inferences from encrypted DNS traffic. First, we provide an overview of various standards developed in the space of DNS encryption and their adoption status, performance, benefits, and security issues. Second, we highlight ways that various malware families can exploit DNS encryption to their advantage for botnet communications and/or data exfiltration. Third, we discuss existing inference methods for profiling normal patterns and/or detecting malicious encrypted DNS traffic. Several directions are presented to motivate future research in enhancing the performance and security of DNS encryption.

> Machine learning has witnessed tremendous growth in its adoption and advancement in the last decade. The evolution of machine learning from traditional algorithms to modern deep learning architectures has shaped the way today's technology functions. Its unprecedented ability to discover knowledge/patterns from unstructured data and automate the decision-making process led to its application in wide domains. High flying machine learning arena has been recently pegged back by the introduction of adversarial attacks. Adversaries are able to modify data, maximizing the classification error of the models. The discovery of blind spots in machine learning models has been exploited by adversarial attackers by generating subtle intentional perturbations in test samples. Increasing dependency on data has paved the blueprint for ever-high incentives to camouflage machine learning models. To cope with probable catastrophic consequences in the future, continuous research is required to find vulnerabilities in form of adversarial and design remedies in systems. This survey aims at providing the encyclopedic introduction to adversarial attacks that are carried out against malware detection systems. The paper will introduce various machine learning techniques used to generate adversarial and explain the structure of target files. The survey will also model the threat posed by the adversary and followed by brief descriptions of widely accepted adversarial algorithms. Work will provide a taxonomy of adversarial evasion attacks on the basis of attack domain and adversarial generation techniques. Adversarial evasion attacks carried out against malware detectors will be discussed briefly under each taxonomical headings and compared with concomitant researches. Analyzing the current research challenges in an adversarial generation, the survey will conclude by pinpointing the open future research directions.

<summary>2022-01-07 17:23:19 - Game-Theoretic Malware Detection</summary>

- *Revan MacQueen, Natalie Bombardieri, James R. Wright, Karim Ali*

> Malware attacks are costly. To mitigate against such attacks, organizations deploy malware detection tools that help them detect and eventually resolve those threats. While running only the best available tool does not provide enough coverage of the potential attacks, running all available tools is prohibitively expensive in terms of financial cost and computing resources. Therefore, an organization typically runs a set of tools that maximizes their coverage given a limited budget. However, how should an organization choose that set? Attackers are strategic, and will change their behavior to preferentially exploit the gaps left by a deterministic choice of tools. To avoid leaving such easily-exploited gaps, the defender must choose a random set.   In this paper, we present an approach to compute an optimal randomization over size-bounded sets of available security analysis tools by modeling the relationship between attackers and security analysts as a leader-follower Stackelberg security game. We estimate the parameters of our model by combining the information from the VirusTotal dataset with the more detailed reports from the National Vulnerability Database. In an empirical comparison, our approach outperforms a set of natural baselines under a wide range of assumptions.

<summary>2022-01-08 02:11:09 - Trade-offs between membership privacy & adversarially robust learning</summary>

> Historically, machine learning methods have not been designed with security in mind. In turn, this has given rise to adversarial examples, carefully perturbed input samples aimed to mislead detection at test time, which have been applied to attack spam and malware classification, and more recently to attack image classification. Consequently, an abundance of research has been devoted to designing machine learning methods that are robust to adversarial examples. Unfortunately, there are desiderata besides robustness that a secure and safe machine learning model must satisfy, such as fairness and privacy. Recent work by Song et al. (2019) has shown, empirically, that there exists a trade-off between robust and private machine learning models. Models designed to be robust to adversarial examples often overfit on training data to a larger extent than standard (non-robust) models. If a dataset contains private information, then any statistical test that separates training and test data by observing a model's outputs can represent a privacy breach, and if a model overfits on training data, these statistical tests become easier.   In this work, we identify settings where standard models will overfit to a larger extent in comparison to robust models, and as empirically observed in previous works, settings where the opposite behavior occurs. Thus, it is not necessarily the case that privacy must be sacrificed to achieve robustness. The degree of overfitting naturally depends on the amount of data available for training. We go on to characterize how the training set size factors into the privacy risks exposed by training a robust model on a simple Gaussian data task, and show empirically that our findings hold on image classification benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

<summary>2022-01-12 08:29:24 - Real-time malware process detection and automated process killing</summary>

- *Matilda Rhode, Pete Burnap, Adam Wedgbury*

- `1902.02598v3` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02598v3) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.02598v3)

> Perimeter-based detection is no longer sufficient for mitigating the threat posed by malicious software. This is evident as antivirus (AV) products are replaced by endpoint detection and response (EDR) products, the latter allowing visibility into live machine activity rather than relying on the AV to filter out malicious artefacts. This paper argues that detecting malware in real-time on an endpoint necessitates an automated response due to the rapid and destructive nature of some malware.   The proposed model uses statistical filtering on top of a machine learning dynamic behavioural malware detection model in order to detect individual malicious processes on the fly and kill those which are deemed malicious. In an experiment to measure the tangible impact of this system, we find that fast-acting ransomware is prevented from corrupting 92% of files with a false positive rate of 14%. Whilst the false-positive rate currently remains too high to adopt this approach as-is, these initial results demonstrate the need for a detection model which is able to act within seconds of the malware execution beginning; a timescale that has not been addressed by previous work.

<summary>2022-01-14 07:57:12 - Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response Engine for Deployment of Behavioural Honeypots</summary>

- `2201.05326v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05326v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05326v1)

> Cyber Security is a critical topic for organizations with IT/OT networks as they are always susceptible to attack, whether insider or outsider. Since the cyber landscape is an ever-evolving scenario, one must keep upgrading its security systems to enhance the security of the infrastructure. Tools like Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Information Technology Service Management (ITSM), along with other defensive techniques like Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Protection System (IPS), and many others enhance the cyber security posture of the infrastructure. However, the proposed protection mechanisms have their limitations, they are insufficient to ensure security, and the attacker penetrates the network. Deception technology, along with Honeypots, provides a false sense of vulnerability in the target systems to the attackers. The attacker deceived reveals threat intel about their modus operandi. We have developed a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) Engine that dynamically deploys custom honeypots inside the internal network infrastructure based on the attacker's behavior. The architecture is robust enough to support multiple VLANs connected to the system and used for orchestration. The presence of botnet traffic and DDOS attacks on the honeypots in the network is detected, along with a malware collection system. After being exposed to live traffic for four days, our engine dynamically orchestrated the honeypots 40 times, detected 7823 attacks, 965 DDOS attack packets, and three malicious samples. While our experiments with static honeypots show an average attacker engagement time of 102 seconds per instance, our SOAR Engine-based dynamic honeypots engage attackers on average 3148 seconds.

<summary>2022-01-16 08:01:18 - Explaining and Measuring Functionalities of Malware Detectors</summary>

- *Wei Wang, Ruoxi Sun, Tian Dong, Shaofeng Li, Minhui Xue, Gareth Tyson, Haojin Zhu*

- `2111.10085v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10085v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10085v2)

> Numerous open-source and commercial malware detectors are available. However, their efficacy is threatened by new adversarial attacks, whereby malware attempts to evade detection, e.g., by performing feature-space manipulation. In this work, we propose an explainability-guided and model-agnostic framework for measuring the ability of malware to evade detection. The framework introduces the concept of Accrued Malicious Magnitude (AMM) to identify which malware features should be manipulated to maximize the likelihood of evading detection. We then use this framework to test several state-of-the-art malware detectors ability to detect manipulated malware. We find that (i) commercial antivirus engines are vulnerable to AMM-guided manipulated samples; (ii) the ability of a manipulated malware generated using one detector to evade detection by another detector (i.e., transferability) depends on the overlap of features with large AMM values between the different detectors; and (iii) AMM values effectively measure the importance of features and explain the ability to evade detection. Our findings shed light on the weaknesses of current malware detectors, as well as how they can be improved.
